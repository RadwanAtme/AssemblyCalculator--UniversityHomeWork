# AssemblyCalculator--UniversityHomeWork
this was the second homework of the course 234118 - Computer Organization And Programming (ATAM)<br>
in this project we were asked to implement a calculator that recives a string from the command line and returns the solutions using intel x86-64 AT&T<br>
we were tasked to write the file hw2_sol.asm<br>
i sat with my partner and decided on the algorithem that he suggested to solve the proplem,and then due to the pressure of other courses homeworks <br>
and the diffuculty we found in writing assembly code in pairs in a short time with all the little details we had to look for we ultimatly decided<br>
that he would take care of the dry homework and i would implement the wet homework and to help each other when we finish our part, so the code except<br>
for the print function was written by me<br>
to compile run:<br>
as hw2_sol.asm -o hw2_sol.o<br>
gcc -no-pie calc.c hw2_sol.o -o calc<br>
./calc<br>
