# AssemblyCalculator--UniversityHomeWork
this was the second homework of the course 234118 - Computer Organization And Programming (ATAM),
in this project we were asked to implement a calculator that recives a string from the command line and returns the solutions using intel x86-64 AT&T
i sat with my partner and decided on the algorithem that he suggested to solve the proplem,and then due to the pressure of other courses homeworks 
and the diffuculty we found in writing assembly code in pairs in a short time with all the little details we had to look for we ultimatly decided
that he would take care of the dry homework and i would implement the wet homework and to help each other when we finish our part, so the code except
for the print function was written by me
